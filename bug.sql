In SQL, a common yet often subtle error arises from implicit type conversions.  Consider a query involving a comparison between a numeric column and a string literal.  If the column is an integer, and you compare it to a string '10', the database might implicitly convert the string to a number, but this conversion can fail unexpectedly if the string is not a valid number. This can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_integer_column = '10a';
```

In this example, the string '10a' cannot be implicitly converted to an integer, which results in the comparison always evaluating to false, even if there are rows where `my_integer_column` is 10.  Similar issues can occur with date and time comparisons, leading to inaccurate results.
